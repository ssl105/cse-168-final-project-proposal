# Project Proposal

I was first interested in implementing the interaction between gems and aurora borealis, but after doing some preliminary research it would
have been to much to handle alone given the timespan. So, I decided to simply focus on rendering gems and implementing the research from
this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015706.1015708).
